    "prompt": "In markdown format: Answer this D&D question simply, then give a detailed explanation: Item Armour class",
    "response": "### Simple Answer:\nIn Dungeons & Dragons (D&D), **Armour Class (AC)** is a number that represents how hard it is to hit a character or creature with an attack. The higher the AC, the harder it is to land a successful hit.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Explanation:\n\n**Armour Class (AC)** is one of the most important defensive statistics in *Dungeons & Dragons*, primarily used to determine a character\u2019s or monster\u2019s ability to avoid being hit in combat.\n\n#### How AC Works:\n- When one creature attacks another, the attacker rolls a **d20** and adds their **attack bonus** (which includes ability modifier and proficiency, if applicable).\n- If the total equals or exceeds the target\u2019s **Armour Class**, the attack hits.\n- If it\u2019s lower, the attack misses.\n\n#### What Determines AC?\nA character\u2019s AC is usually calculated based on one of the following:\n\n1. **Unarmoured**:\n   - **Monk**: `10 + Dexterity modifier + Wisdom modifier`\n   - **Barbarian (while not wearing armour)**: `10 + Dexterity modifier + Constitution modifier`\n   - **Regular unarmoured character**: `10 + Dexterity modifier` (often seen with spellcasters)\n\n2. **Wearing Armour**:\n   - Different armours provide a base AC (e.g., leather = 11 + Dex, chain mail = 16).\n   - Some armours have maximum Dex bonuses or require strength.\n   - Example: **Chain Mail** gives AC 16, but you need Strength 13 and can't add Dexterity bonus.\n\n3. **Shields**:\n   - A **shield** adds +2 to AC if used (e.g., carrying a shield raises a 16 AC to 18).\n\n4. **Magic Items and Special Abilities**:\n   - Items like *+1 chain mail* increase AC by 1.\n   - Spells (e.g., *Mage Armor* gives 13 + Dex modifier) or class features (e.g., *Draconic Resilience* for Sorcerers) can also set or modify AC.\n\n#### Example:\n- A Fighter wearing **half plate** (AC 15 + Dex modifier, max +2) with a **shield** (+2), Dexterity modifier +2:  \n  `15 + 2 (Dex) + 2 (shield) = AC 19`\n\n#### Importance:\nAC is crucial because it\u2019s your first line of defense. High AC means enemies will miss more often, keeping your character alive longer in combat.\n\nIn summary, **Armour Class (AC)** is a measure of how tough you are to hit\u2014it\u2019s determined by your armour, shield, Dexterity, class features, and magic items."

    "prompt": "In markdown format: Answer this D&D question simply, then give a detailed explanation: Armour class of wood",
    "response": "### Simple Answer:\nWood doesn't have a standard armor class (AC) in Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition. Objects like wooden doors or barriers are typically given an AC between **15 and 17**, depending on thickness and construction.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Explanation:\n\nIn **Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition**, *armor class (AC)* is a measure of how hard it is to hit something. While creatures and characters have defined AC values based on armor, shields, and dexterity, **objects like wood** are handled differently.\n\nWood itself isn't a creature or piece of armor, so it doesn't have a fixed AC. However, **wooden objects** (such as doors, walls, chests, or beams) do have AC values when they become relevant in gameplay \u2014 for example, when a player tries to break down a door or a monster attacks a wooden barrier.\n\nAccording to the *Dungeon Master\u2019s Guide (DMG)* and *Dungeon Master\u2019s Workshop* rules (p. 246\u2013247), **objects** have AC and hit points based on their material and size:\n\n#### Typical AC for Wooden Objects:\n- **Hempen rope**: AC 11\n- **Silk rope**: AC 12\n- **Common wooden door**: AC **15**\n- **Strong wooden wall or thick beam**: AC **17**\n\nSo, while **\"wood\"** as a material isn't assigned one universal AC, **wooden barriers** generally have an AC of **15 to 17**.\n\n#### Factors That Affect AC:\n- **Construction quality** (crudely built vs. reinforced)\n- **Thickness** (a thin plank vs. a 1-foot-thick wooden portcullis)\n- **DM discretion** \u2014 ultimately, the DM decides based on the situation\n\nAdditionally, wooden objects often have vulnerabilities, such as being flammable (taking extra fire damage) and having resistance or immunity to certain damage types (e.g., poison, psychic).\n\n**Example**: A typical heavy wooden door might have:\n- **AC: 15**\n- **HP: 30**\n- **Immunities**: Poison, psychic\n- **Vulnerability**: Fire damage\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- **No universal AC for \"wood\"**, but wooden objects typically have **AC 15\u201317**.\n- Use DMG guidelines to assign AC and HP based on object type.\n- Always consider context, material quality, and DM judgment."

    "response": "In physics, the **fundamental forces** are the four basic interactions that govern all processes in the universe. These forces are: **gravity**, **electromagnetism**, the **strong nuclear force**, and the **weak nuclear force**. Gravity is the most familiar\u2014it attracts objects with mass and shapes the large-scale structure of the cosmos, from planets to galaxies\u2014but it is actually the weakest of the four. Electromagnetism governs electric and magnetic fields, responsible for light, chemistry, and most everyday forces (except gravity), acting between charged particles. This force is much stronger than gravity and has infinite range.\n\nThe strong nuclear force binds protons and neutrons together in the atomic nucleus, overcoming the electromagnetic repulsion between positively charged protons. It operates only at extremely short distances\u2014within the nucleus\u2014but is the strongest of the four forces. The weak nuclear force is responsible for certain types of radioactive decay and nuclear reactions, such as those powering the sun; it acts at even shorter ranges and plays a key role in transforming one type of subatomic particle into another. Scientists have unified electromagnetism and the weak force into the *electroweak force* at high energies, and ongoing research seeks a \"Theory of Everything\" that unifies all four forces."

The play highlights the destructive power of insecurity and deception, as well as the tragic consequences of allowing prejudice and blind trust to override reason and love.

Othello secretly marries Desdemona, a noblewoman, which causes tension with her father and stirs resentment in those around him\u2014most notably Iago, his envious and deceitful ensign. Passed over for promotion in favor of Michael Cassio, Iago devises a cunning plot to destroy Othello by planting seeds of doubt about Desdemona\u2019s fidelity. Using lies, insinuations, and a stolen handkerchief as supposed evidence, Iago convinces Othello that Desdemona is having an affair with Cassio.\n\nConsumed by jealousy and insecurity, Othello spirals into rage and despair, ultimately suffocating Desdemona in a tragic act of misguided love. When the truth is revealed\u2014too late\u2014by Emilia, Iago\u2019s wife and Desdemona\u2019s attendant, Othello is overcome with grief and takes his own life.

Now married to Hamlet\u2019s mother, Queen Gertrude, Claudius sits on the throne, fueling Hamlet\u2019s anger and uncertainty.

His inner turmoil\u2014captured in iconic soliloquies like \u201cTo be, or not to be\u201d\u2014reflects universal questions of existence, morality, and the consequences of indecision. A play-within-a-play confirms Claudius\u2019s guilt, but Hamlet\u2019s hesitation leads to tragic mistakes, including the killing of Polonius. This sets off a chain of vengeance: Ophelia descends into madness and dies, her brother Laertes seeks retribution, and Claudius plots Hamlet\u2019s demise. In the bloody climax, nearly all main characters die\u2014including Hamlet himself\u2014leaving Denmark in ruins and raising haunting questions about justice, fate, and the human soul."

It follows Nick Carraway, a Yale graduate and World War I veteran, who moves to West Egg on Long Island and becomes neighbors with the mysterious and wealthy Jay Gatsby. Gatsby is known for throwing extravagant parties, but remains an enigma to his guests. As Nick gets drawn into Gatsby\u2019s world, he learns that Gatsby\u2019s wealth and lavish lifestyle are all part of a grand obsession: winning back his former lover, Daisy Buchanan, who is now married to the wealthy but arrogant Tom Buchanan. Through Nick, Gatsby reconnects with Daisy, reigniting a romance that ultimately unravels under the weight of lies, class divisions, and unattainable dreams.\n\nThe novel explores themes of illusion versus reality, the American Dream, and the moral decay beneath the glittering surface of wealth. Despite Gatsby\u2019s idealism and relentless hope, his dream of re-creating the past with Daisy is doomed from the start. The tragic climax\u2014marked by betrayal, a hit-and-run accident, and Gatsby\u2019s lonely death\u2014exposes the emptiness of the upper class and the fragility of aspirational dreams. In the end, *The Great Gatsby* paints a poignant portrait of a man destroyed by his own unrealistic visions, while also offering a critical commentary on the illusion of progress and success in America."

    "response": "**Quick Answer:** The PARA method is a note-taking system that organizes information around Projects, Areas, Resources, and Archives, making it ideal for managing both projects and research.\n\n**Detailed Summary:** The PARA method, developed by Tiago Forte, is a productivity and note-taking framework that categorizes information into four buckets: **Projects** (short-term goals with a deadline), **Areas** (long-term responsibilities or interests), **Resources** (topics or subjects of ongoing research), and **Archives** (inactive items). This system excels at integrating active project management with long-term research because Resources can store collected knowledge, references, and ideas that support current or future projects. By organizing notes this way, users can easily connect research to actionable tasks, ensuring information is both accessible and purposeful."
